1.1-1 Fix to honor subset argument when data option is not specified and
      added details to NAMESPACE file
1.1-0 Fix to remove unused levels from group factors. Fix to change
      lwd in lineplot.CI when no group factors are specified.
1.0-9 Fix to remove unused levels from factors. Change default
      ordering of factor levels in legend when more than one group factor.
1.0-8 Fix to honor factor levels with more than one group factor
1.0-7 Fix to default ylim when all negative values in bargraph.CI
1.0-6 Fix for legend code with fixed=TRUE in lineplot.CI
1.0-5 Fix for incomplete factorial designs in bargraph.CI
1.0-4 Remove period from GPL license
1.0-3 Fix for labeling legend with "fixed=TRUE" option
1.0-2 Fix to enable "las" parameter in lineplot.CI
1.0-1 Fix for unbalanced designs.

      utility function dev2ps.
0.7-0 Change trace.factor to group. Add option to create a "split plot" for the
